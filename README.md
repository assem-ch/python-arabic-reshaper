##    Python Arabic Reshaper
Reconstruct Arabic sentences to be used in applications that don't support Arabic

Based on [Better Arabic Reshaper](https://github.com/agawish/Better-Arabic-Reshaper/), ported to Python, tweaked a little bit.

For more info visit my blog [post here](http://mpcabd.xyz/python-arabic-text-reshaper/)

## Install
You can install the library using:
    
    sudo pip install arabic_reshaper


Or you can clone the code and run:

    sudo python setup.py install

## Usage

    import arabic_reshaper
    reshaped_text = arabic_reshaper.reshape(u'اللغة العربية رائعة')

## Known Issue
[Harakat or Tashkeel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritics#Tashkil_.28marks_used_as_phonetic_guides.29) are not supported, and I think that they can't be supported as their unicode characters are non-spacing marks (i.e. they don't take space, they are rendered in the same space of the character before them), which means that when used in a reshaper, they will be rendered on the next character as the text is reversed.
